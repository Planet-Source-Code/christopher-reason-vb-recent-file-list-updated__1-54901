## VB Recent File List \- Updated


</div>

### Description

With this project you can delete items from you registry that show up in the Recent Files list of Visual Basic. Please note that, running the program from the VB IDE will NOT delete items permanently from the list. The reason for this is: When VB is closed it "re-saves" the recent list. So you must compile the project to EXE form, close VB and run the EXE to make it work.

UPDATE - Now displays project that no longer exist in red.

Other examples in this project include:

*Resizing Columns in a List View

*Sorting Columns in a List View

You can also find a Microsoft reference for the object used in this code sample at http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/script56/html/wsmthregread.asp (Look for RegWrite, RegRead and RegDelete)

Thanks for taking the time to look at my example and I hope you find it useful for something :)

Christopher.
 
### More Info
 
Realize that VB "re-writes" the recent list every time it closes, so, to delete items from your recent list, you must compile this project, close VB and then run the EXE to delete items from the recent files list.
